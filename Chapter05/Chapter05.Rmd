# Line Fitting, Residuals and Correlation

## Modeling Numerical Variables

In this unit we will learn to quantify the relationship between two numerical variables, as well as modeling numerical response variables using a numerical or categorical explanatory variable.

## Poverty versus High School graduation rate

The **scatterplot** below shows the relationship between HS graduate rate in all 50 US states and DC and the percent of residents who live below the poverty line (income below $23,050 for a family of 4 in 2012).

# Fitting a line by least squares regression

## Eyeballing the line

<div style = "float:left; position: relative;">
Which of the following appears to be the line that best fits the linear relationship between percentage in poverty and percentage of HS grad? Choose one.
</div>
<div style = "float:right;position: relative;">
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_5_2_linear_fits.png")
```
</div>

## Eyeballing the linear

<div style = "float:left; position: relative;">
Which of the following appears to be the line that best fits the linear relationship between percentage in poverty and percentage of HS grad? Choose one.

The best fit appears to be **(a)** (over (d)). (b) and (c) aren't good fits at all.
</div>
<div style = "float:right;position: relative;">
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_5_2_linear_fits.png")
```
</div>

## Residuals

**Residuals** are the leftovers from the model fit. 

$$
\text{Data} = \text{Fit} + \text{Residuals}
$$

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_5_2_residual.png")
```
</center>

## Residuals (ctd.)

**Residuals** are the difference between the observed ($y_i$) and the predicted ($\hat{y}_i$). We label these as $e_i$.

$$
e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i
$$

**Note**: the other way is **not** correct! We always take observed *minus* predicted, not the other way around.

## Residuals (ctd.)

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_5_2_residual2.png")
```
</center>

The labeled points indicate that:

* % living in poverty in DC is 5.44% more than predicted.
* % living in poverty in RI is 4.16% less than predicted.

## A measure for the best line

## The least squares line

<center>
```{r, out.width = "750px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_5_2_ls_explained.png")
```
</center>

**Notation**:

* Intercept
    - Parameter: $\beta_0$
    - Point estimate: $b_0$
* Slope
    - Parameter: $\beta_1$
    - Point estimate: $b_1$

## Given $\ldots$

<center>
```{r, out.width = "850px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_5_2_hs_details.png")
```
</center>

## Slope

The slope of the regression line (remember: $y = mx + b$) can be calculated as

$$
b_1 = \frac{s_y}{s_x} R
$$

In context:

$$
b_1 = \frac{3.1}{3.73} \cdot -0.75 = -0.62
$$

**Interpretation**: for each additional percentage point in HS graduation rate, we would expect the percentage living in poverty to be lower on average by 0.62% points.

## Intercept

The intercept is where the regression line intersects the y-axis. The calculation of the intercept uses the fact the a regression line always passes through ($\bar{x}, \bar{y}$).

<center>
$$
b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x}
$$
</center>

<center>
```{r, out.width = "750px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_5_2_intercept.png")
```
</center>

## Intercept

<center>
$$
b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x}
$$

```{r, out.width = "650px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_5_2_intercept.png")
```
</center>

We calculate:
$$
b_0 = 11.35 - (-0.62) \cdot 86.01 = 64.68
$$

## Practice

Which of the following is the correct interpretation of the intercept?

* For each % point increase in HS graduation rates, the % living in poverty is expected to increase on average by 64.68%.
* For each % point decrease in HS graduation rate, the % living in poverty is expected to increase on average by 64.68%.
* Having no HS graduates leads to 64.68% of residents living below the poverty line.
* States with no HS graduates are expected on average to have 64.68% of residents living below the poverty line.
* In states with no HS graduates the % living in poverty is expected to increase on average by 64.68%.

## Practice

Which of the following is the correct interpretation of the intercept?

* For each % point increase in HS graduation rates, the % living in poverty is expected to increase on average by 64.68%.
* For each % point decrease in HS graduation rate, the % living in poverty is expected to increase on average by 64.68%.
* Having no HS graduates leads to 64.68% of residents living below the poverty line.
* **States with no HS graduates are expected on average to have 64.68% of residents living below the poverty line.**
* In states with no HS graduates the % living in poverty is expected to increase on average by 64.68%.

## More on the intercept

Since there are no states in the data set with zero HS graduates, the intercept is of no interest, not very useful, and also **not reliable** since the predicted value of the intecept is so far from **all** of the data.

## Regression Line

<center>
```{r, out.width = "650px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_5_2_regression_line.png")
```
</center>


## Interpretation of slope and intercept

<div style = "float:left; position: relative;">
* **Intercept**: when $x=0$, $y$ is expected to equal the intercept
* **Slope**: for each unit change in $x$, $y$ is expected to increase/decrease on average by the value of the slope.
</div>
<div style = "float:right; position: relative;">
```{r, out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_5_2_idealized_reg.png")
```
</div>

**Note**: these statements are **not** causal, unless the study is a randomized controlled experiment.

## Prediction

* Using the linear model to predict the value of the response variable for a given value of the explanatory variable is called **prediction**, and consists of plugging the value of $x$ into the linear model equation
* There will be some uncertainty associated with the predicted value

<center>
```{r, out.width = "750px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_5_2_prediction.png")
```
</center>

## Extrapolation

* Applying a model estimate to values outside of the range of the original data is called **extrapolation**
* Sometimes the intercept is an extrapolation

<center>
```{r, out.width = "750px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_5_2_intercept.png")
```
</center>

**How do outliers influence the least squares line in this plot?**

To answer this question think of where the regression line would be with and without the outlier(s). Without the outliers the regression line would be steeper, and lie closer to the larger group of observations. With the outliers the line is pulled up and away from some of the observations in the larger group.

## Some Terminology

* **Outliers** are points that lie away from the cloud  of points.

## Some Terminology

* **Outliers** are points that lie away from the cloud  of points.
* Outliers that lie horizontally away from the center of the cloud are called **high leverage** points.

## Some Terminology

* **Outliers** are points that lie away from the cloud  of points.
* Outliers that lie horizontally away from the center of the cloud are called **high leverage** points.
* High leverage points that actually influence the slope of the regression line are called **influential** points.

## Some Terminology

* **Outliers** are points that lie away from the cloud  of points.
* Outliers that lie horizontally away from the center of the cloud are called **high leverage** points.
* High leverage points that actually influence the slope of the regression line are called **influential** points.
* In order to determine if a point is influential, visualize the regression line with and without the point. Does the slope of the line change considerably? If so, then the point is influential. If not, then itâ€™s not an influential point.A

In 1966 Cyril Burt published a paper called *The genetic determination of differences in intelligence: A study of monozygotic twins reared apart?* The data consist of IQ scores for (an assumed random sample of) 27 identical twins, one raised by foster parents, the other by the biological parents.

## Testing for the Slope

Assuming that these 27 twins comprise a representative sample of all twins separated at birth, we would like to test if these data provide convincing evidence that the IQ of the biological twin is a significant predictor of IQ of the foster twin. What are the appropriate hypotheses?
