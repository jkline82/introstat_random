# Inference for a Single Proportion

## Practice

Two scientists want to know if a certain drug is effective against high blood pressure. The first scientist wants to give the drug to 1000 people with high blood pressure and see how many of them experience lower blood pressure levels. The second scientist wants to give the drug to 500 people with high blood pressure, and not give the drug to another 500 people with high blood pressure, and see how many in both groups experience lower blood pressure levels. Which is the better way to test this drug?

1. All 1000 get the drug
2. 500 get the drug, 500 don’t

## Comments on Transition to Ch 3

Now that we're entering Chapter 3, we will be revisiting a lot of the ideas we saw in Chapters 1 and 2, but adding mathematical formality to things. 

All the spots in the previous weeks where we said "we'll revisit this later" will be coming up in the next little while.

## Results from the GSS

The General Social Survey (GSS) collects information and keep a historical record of the concerns, experiences, attitudes, and practices of residents of the United States. Since 1972, the GSS has been monitoring societal change and studying the growing complexity of American society. Canada has been running a similar survey since 1985. 

The GSS asks the question from the previous slide. Below is the distribution of responses from the 2010 survey:

All 1000 get the drug                99
---------------------                ---
500 get the drug, 500 don't          571
Total                                670

## Parameter and Point Estimation

We would like to estimate the proportion of all Americans who have good intuition about experimental design, i.e., would answer “500 get the drug, 500 don't”? What are the parameter of interest and the point estimate?

<span id="highlight">Parameter of Interest</span>: Proportion of **all** Americans who have good intuition about experimental design

**p**: a population proportion

<span id="highlight">Point Estimate</span>: proportion of **sampled** Americans who have good intuition about experimental design.

**$\hat{p}$**: a sample proportion

## Inference on a Proportion

What percent of all Americans have good intuition about experimental design, i.e., would answer "500 get the drug
500 don't"?

<span id="highlight">We can answer this question using a confidence interval, which (from Ch. 2) we know is always of the form 
<center>
point estimate $\pm$ ME
</center>
where
<center>
$\text{ME} = z^* \times \text{SE}$.
</center>

So what is the SE of our point estimate, $\text{SE}_{\hat{p}}$?

## New Formula: SE of a Point Estimate $\hat{p}$

When we have a **sample proportion**, the standard error has a known formula:

$$
\text{SE}_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}
$$

What are $p$ and $n$?

1. $n$ is the number of samples (it's a **sample proportion**)
2. $p$ is the true underlying population proportion ...

But we don't know $p$!

We "cheat" here, and replace $p$ with $\hat{p}$. It mostly works.

## Sample Proportions are Almost Normally Distributed

Remember the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) from Ch.2. 

Sample proportions will be nearly normally distributed with mean equal to the population mean, $p$, and standard error equal to $\text{SE}_\hat{p}$ from the last slide. We can write this formally.

$$
\hat{p} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \text{mean} = p, \text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \right)
$$

But, of course, this is only true under certain conditions ... <span id="highlight">any guesses?</span>

<span id="highlight">The requirements of the CLT! Independent observations, and "enough" samples</span>

## Rule of Thumb for Proportions

There is a rule of thumb for what "enough samples" means for a sample proportion inference:

1. At least 10 success cases
2. At least 10 failure cases

If you do not have the above, the CLT may not be a good approximation. 

## Linking Back to Ch. 2

Remember what we did in our case studies in Ch. 2. We can **always** use the simulation (permutation test) method, and it will give good results. But it's a lot of work.

So we introduced the normal method and the normal approximation. Because it can be done without a computer, and is sometimes faster.

**But**: it doesn't always work! Keep this in mind.

Given: 

* $n = 670$
* $\hat{p} = 0.852$

Check the conditions!

1. **Independence**: The GSS is sampled randomly, and the population is much larger than the sample, so we can assume the responses are random.

## Practice
We are given $n=670$, $\hat{p} =0.852$, and we know that 
$$
\text{SE}_\hat{p} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}.
$$
Which of the following is the correct calculation of the 95% confidence interval?

1. $0.852 \pm 1.96 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.85(0.15)}{670}}$
2. $0.852 \pm 1.65 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.85(0.15)}{670}}$
3. $0.852 \pm 1.96 \times \frac{0.85(0.15)}{\sqrt{670}}$
4. $571 \pm 1.96 \times \frac{571(99)}{670}$

1. <span id="highlight">$0.852 \pm 1.96 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.85(0.15)}{670}} = (0.825, 0.879)$</span>

4. $571 \pm 1.96 \times \frac{571(99)}{670}$

## New Idea: Choosing a Sample Size

We now have the formulas which allow us to compute confidence intervals using the normal approximation for sample proportions.

<span id="highlight">How many people should you sample in order to cut the margin of error of a 95% confidence interval down to 1%?</span>

0.01 &\geq 1.96 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.85(0.15)}{n}}
\end{split}
$$

(since 1% = 0.01, 95% CI means use $z^* = 1.96$, and we're still interested in the GSS question)

\end{split}
$$

<span id="highlight">Therefore we need at least 4,899 samples to cut the ME of a 95% confidence interval (for this problem) down to 1%.</span>

## A Tricky Bit

You may have noticed that we assumed that the ME for the new sample would be the same as the old sample: we used 0.85 and 0.15 in our formula!

This is common if we are repeating a study. The first study is sometimes called a **pilot study**, and it gives us a rough idea what our $\hat{p}$ might be.

What if we didn't have a pilot study to rely on?

<span id="highlight">Use the default $\hat{p} = 0.5$.</span>

## A Tricky Bit

Why would $\hat{p} = 0.50$ be a default?

* If you don't know any better, 50/50 guessing seems reasonable
* Using $\hat{p} = 0.50$ is the most conservative estimate, and gives the highest possible sample size number


(for those who have some calculus and are curious) 0.5 is a maximum because the formula has $\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})$, which is a quadratic function of $\hat{p}$, which has a local maximum at $\hat{p} = 0.50$.

## Confidence Intervals versus Hypothesis Testing

<div style="text-size:18px; top:-20px;">
We have slightly different **Success-Failure Conditions** (for number of samples required):

* **CI**: at least 10 *observed* successes and failures
* **HT**: at least 10 *expected* successes and failures, under the null assumption

## Confidence Intervals versus Hypothesis Testing

<div style="text-size:18px; top:-20px;">
**Standard Error**

* **CI**: calculated using the sample proportion, $\hat{p}$
$$
\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}.
$$
* **HT**: calculated using the null hypothesis value, $p_0$
$$
\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}.
$$
</div>

## Practice

The GSS found that 571 out of 670 (85%) of Americans answered the question on experimental design correctly. Do these data provide convincing evidence that more than 80% of Americans have a good intuition about experimental design?

$$
H_0: p = 0.80 \qquad \; \qquad H_A: p > 0.80
$$
(we use a one-tailed hypothesis test because that is our question: "more than 80%")

## Practice

$$
\begin{split}
H_0: p = 0.80 \qquad &\; \qquad H_A: p > 0.80\\
\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{0.80(0.20)}{670}} &= 0.0154\\
\end{split}
$$

\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{0.80(0.20)}{670}} &= 0.0154\\
Z = \frac{0.85 - 0.80}{0.0154} &= 3.25 \\
\end{split}
$$

## Practice (*p*-value)

Compute the *p*-value for this value of $z$.

**Method 1**:
Use R!
```{r}
1 - pnorm(3.25)
```
So the *p*-value is 0.0006.

(Why did we use **1-pnorm()**? Because we want the area to the **right**, and **pnorm()** gives the area to the **left**!)

## Practice (*p*-value)

Compute the *p*-value for this value of $z$.

**Method 2**:
Look up the value in a table

<center>
```{r, out.width = "750px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_1_ztable.png")
```
</center>

So the *p*-value is 1-0.9994 = 0.0006.

## Practice: Conclusion

Since the *p*-value is low, we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that more than 80% of Americans have a good intuition on experimental design.

## Practice

11% of 1,001 Americans responding to a 2006 Gallup survey stated that they have objections to celebrating Halloween on religious grounds. At 95% confidence level, the margin of error for this survey is $\pm 3$%. A news piece on this study's findings states: "More than 10% of all Americans have objections on religious grounds to celebrating Halloween." At 95% confidence level, is this news piece's statement justified?

1. Yes
2. No
3. Can’t tell

# Difference of Two Proportions

## Melting ice cap
Scientists predict that global warming may have big effects on the polar regions within the next 100 years. One of the possible effects is that the northern ice cap may completely melt. Would this bother you a great deal, some, a little, or not at all if it actually happened?

1. A great deal
2. Some
3. A little
4. Not at all

## Results from the GSS

## Connection to One Proportion

Think back to the one proportion approach.

* When constructing a CI for a population proportion, we check if the **observed** numbers of successes and failures are at least 10. <br/>
$$
n\hat{p} > 10 \; \qquad \; n \cdot (1-\hat{p}) \geq 10
$$
* When conducting a HT for a population proportion, we check if the **expected** numbers of successes and failures are at least 10. <br/>
$$
np_0 > 10 \; \qquad \; n \cdot (1-p_0) \geq 10
$$

## Pooled estimate of a proportion

* In the case of comparing two proportions where $H_0: p_1 = p_2$, there isn't a given null value we can use to calculate the **expected** number of successes and failures in each sample.

* In the case of comparing two proportions where $H_0: p_1 = p_2$, there isn't a given null value we can use to calculate the **expected** number of successes and failures in each sample.

Since our *p*-value is 0.83 (which is not small), we do not have evidence at the 95% confidence level to reject the null hypothesis.

We haven't talked much about working with means (versus proportions), but in this case, it is very rare that $\sigma$ is known, so we usually use the sample standard deviation $s$. 

## Note on Working with Proportions

* When working with proportions,
    - if doing a hypothesis test, $p$ comes from the null hypothesis
    - if constructing a confidence interval, use $\hat{p}$ instead

# Chi-Square Test for Goodness-of-Fit

## Weldon's dice

<div style="float:left; display:inline-block; width:70%; font-size:23px;">
* Walter Frank Raphael Weldon (1860-1906), was an English evolutionary biologist and a founder of biometry. He was the joint founding editor of *Biometrika*, with Francis Galton and Karl Pearson.
* In 1894, he rolled 12 dice 26,306 times, and recorded the number of 5s or 6s (which he considered to be a success).
</div>
<div style="float:right; display:inline-block; width:30%;">
```{r, out.width = "200px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_3_weldon.png")
```
</div>
<div style="font-size:23px;">
*  It was observed that 5s and 6s occurred more often than expected, and Pearson hypothesized that this was probably due to the construction of the dice. Most inexpensive dice have hollowed-out pips, and since opposite sides add to 7, the face with 6 pips is lighter than its opposing face, which has only 1 pip.
</div>

## Labby's Dice

<div style="display:inline-block; float:left; width:70%;">
* In 2009, Zachariah Labby (University of Chicago) repeated Weldon's experiment using a home-made dice-throwing, pip-counting machine.
* The rolling+imaging process took about 20 seconds per roll.
* Each day there were $\approx 150$ images to process manually
* At this rate, Weldon's experiment was repeated in a little more than six full days

## Labby's dice (continued)

* Labby did not actually observe the same phenomenon that Weldon observed (higher frequency of 5s and 6s)
* Automation allowed Labby to collect more data than Weldon did in 1894, so instead of recording "successes" and "failures", Labby recorded the individual number of pips on each die.

## Setting the hypothesis

<span style="font-colour:blue;">Do these data provide convincing evidence of an inconsistency between the observed and expected counts?</span>

$H_0$: There is no inconsistency between the observed and expected counts. **The observed counts follow the same distribution as the expected counts**.

## Setting the hypothesis

<span style="font-colour:blue;">Do these data provide convincing evidence of an inconsistency between the observed and expected counts?</span>

$H_0$: There is no inconsistency between the observed and expected counts. **The observed counts follow the same distribution as the expected counts**.

$H_A$: There is an inconsistency between the observed and the expected counts. **The observed counts do not follow the same distribution as the expected counts**. There is a bias in which side comes up on the roll of a die. 

## Bias

Reminder: in statistics, **bias** refers to the tendency of a measurement process to over- or under-estimate the value of a population parameter. 

In the case of the dice-rolling experiment, the bias is the tendency of rolled dice to (potentially) not show all faces the same proportion of time.

## Evaluating the hypotheses

* To evaluate these hypotheses, we quantify how different the observed counts are from the expected counts

## Evaluating the hypotheses

* To evaluate these hypotheses, we quantify how different the observed counts are from the expected counts
* Large deviations from what would be expected based on sampling variation (chance) alone provide strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis.

## Evaluating the hypotheses

* To evaluate these hypotheses, we quantify how different the observed counts are from the expected counts
* Large deviations from what would be expected based on sampling variation (chance) alone provide strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis.
* This is called a **goodness-of-fit** (or sometimes, a **goodness of fit**) test, since we're evaluating how well the observed data fit the expected distribution.

## Anatomy of a test statistic

The general form of a test statistic is
$$
\frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{\text{SE of point estimate}}
$$

## Anatomy of a test statistic

The general form of a test statistic is
$$
\frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{\text{SE of point estimate}}
$$

This construction is based on

1. Identifying the difference between a point estimate and an expected value if the null hypothesis was true, and
2. Standardizing that difference using the standard error of the point estimate. 

## Anatomy of a test statistic

$$

$$

This construction is based on

1. Identifying the difference between a point estimate and an expected value if the null hypothesis was true, and
2. Standardizing that difference using the standard error of the point estimate. 

These two ideas will help in the construction of an appropriate test statistic for count data.

## Chi-square statistic

When dealing with counts and investigating how far the observed counts are from the expected counts, we use a new test statistic called the chi-square ($\chi^2$) statistic.

$$
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{(O-E)^2}{E}
$$
where $k$ is the total number of cells.

## Summation Notation

We used **summation notation** on the last slide, denoted as
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k}
$$
This is a mathematical short-hand, which stands for "take the sum of the term to the right, allowing the index $i$ to vary from $1$ to $k$. In long form, this reads
$$
\frac{(O_1-E_1)^2}{E_1} + \frac{(O_2-E_2)^2}{E_2} + \cdots + \frac{(O_{k-1}-E_{k-1})^2}{E_{k-1}} + \frac{(O_k-E_k)^2}{E_k}
$$

## Why Square?

Squaring the difference between the observed and expected outcome does two things:

1. Any standardized difference that is squared will now be positive (not randomly positive or negative depending on which is bigger)
2. Difference that already looked unusual will become much larger after being squared.

<span style="font-colour:blue;">When have we seen this before?</span>

## The Chi-square Distribution

* In order to determine if the $\chi^2$ statistic we calculated is considered unusually high or not we need to first describe its distribution.
* The chi-square distribution has just one parameter called degrees of freedom (*df*), which influences the shape, center, and spread of the distribution.

**Remember**

So far we've only seen one continuous distribution: the **normal distribution**, which is unimodal and symmetric with two parameters - the mean and the standard deviation.

In the following chapters we will see a number of other distributions.

<!-- WARNING: this was a really weird slide, unless you do the book out-of-order. At 3.3, we've only seen the Normal: no T, no F, etc. Those aren't introduced until Chapter 4 / appendix. -->

2. The variability of the $\chi^2$ distribution increases as wel
3. The shape of the $\chi^2$ distribution becomes more skewed (less like a normal)

## Finding the tail areas using computation

* While probability tables are very helpful in understanding how probability distributions work, and provide quick reference when computational resources are not available, they are somewhat archaic.
* Using R:
```{r}
pchisq(q = 30, df = 10, lower.tail = FALSE)
```
* Can also use web applets (like: http://bitly.com/dist_calc) or fancy (TI-83+) calculators

## Back to Labby's dice

* The research question was: Do these data provide convincing evidence of an inconsistency between the observed and expected counts?

## Turns out ...
* The 1-6 axis is consistently shorter than the other two (2-5 and 3-4), thereby supporting the hypothesis that the faces with one and six pips are larger than the other faces.
* Pearson's claim that 5s and 6s appear more often due to the carved-out pips is not supported by these data.
* Dice used in casinos have flush faces, where the pips are filled in with a plastic of the same density as the surrounding material and are precisely balanced.

## Recap: *p*-value for a $\chi^2$ test

* The *p*-value for a $\chi^2$ test is defined as the tail area **above** the calculated test statistic
* This is because the test statistic is always positive, and a higher test statistic means a stronger deviation from the null hypothesis

# Chi-Square ($\chi^2$) Test of Independence

## Popular Kids

In the dataset popular, students in grade 4-6 were asked whether good grades, athletic ability, or popularity was most important to them. A two-way table separating students by grade and by choice of their most important factor is shown below. Do these data provide evidence to suggest that goals vary by grade?

<center>
```{r, out.width = "750px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_4_popular_table.png")
```
</center>

## Chi-square test of independence

* The hypotheses are:
    - $H_0$: grade and goals are independent. Goals do not vary by grade.
    - $H_A$: grade and goals are dependent. Goals vary by grade.

## Chi-square test of independence

* The hypotheses are:
    - $H_0$: grade and goals are independent. Goals do not vary by grade.
    - $H_A$: grade and goals are dependent. Goals vary by grade.
* The test statistic is calculated as
$$
\chi^2_{df} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i} \; \text{where} \; df = (R-1) \cdot (C-1)
$$
with $k$ the number of total cells, $R$ the number of rows, and $C$ the number of columns. 


## Notes

* We calculate the **degrees of freedom**, $df$, differently for one- and two-way tables. 
* The *p*-value for this hypothesis test is again the area under the null distribution (in this case, a $\chi^2_{df}$), to the right of the calculated test statistic.

## So what are $O_i$ and $E_i$?

The terms of the summation are $O_i$ and $E_i$. These are the **observed** and **expected** values of each cell of the table. The observed is easy: it's what is listed in the table!

The **expected** takes a bit of work. We have a formula again:
$$
E_i = \frac{(\text{row total}) \cdot (\text{column total})}{\text{table total}}.
$$

<center>
```{r, out.width = "650px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_4_popular_table_totals.png")
```
</center>

## The expected quantities
<center>
```{r, out.width = "650px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_4_popular_table_totals.png")
```
</center>

We compute:

* $E_{\text{row 1, col 1}} = \frac{119 \cdot 247}{478} = 61$.

## The expected quantities
<center>
```{r, out.width = "650px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_4_popular_table_totals.png")
```
</center>

We compute:

* $E_{\text{row 1, col 1}} = \frac{119 \cdot 247}{478} = 61$.
* $E_{\text{row 1, col 2}} = \frac{119 \cdot 141}{478} = 35$.

## Practice
<center>
```{r, out.width = "650px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_4_popular_table_practice.png")
```
</center>
What is the expected count, $E_{\text{row 2, col 2}}$ for the highlighted (in red) cell?

1. $\frac{176 \cdot 141}{478}$
2. $\frac{119 \cdot 141}{478}$
3. $\frac{176 \cdot 247}{478}$
4. $\frac{176 \cdot 478}{478}$

## Practice
<center>
```{r, out.width = "650px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_4_popular_table_practice.png")
```
</center>
What is the expected count, $E_{\text{row 2, col 2}}$ for the highlighted (in red) cell?

1. <span id="highlight">$\frac{176 \cdot 141}{478} = 52$</span>
2. $\frac{119 \cdot 141}{478}$
3. $\frac{176 \cdot 247}{478}$
4. $\frac{176 \cdot 478}{478}$

## Calculating the test statistic

Go through each cell of the table, and compute the expected value for that cell using the formula from the previous slides.

<center>
```{r, out.width = "650px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_4_popular_expected.png")
```
</center>

## Calculating the test statistic

Go through each cell of the table, and compute the expected value for that cell using the formula from the previous slides.

<center>
```{r, out.width = "650px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_4_popular_expected.png")
```
</center>

Then compute the test statistic:
$$
\begin{split}
\chi^2_{df} &= \frac{(63-61)^2}{61} + \frac{(31-35)^2}{35} + \cdots + \frac{(32-34)^2}{34} = 1.3121.\\
df &= (R-1) \cdot (C-1) = (3-1) \cdot (3-1) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4.
\end{split}
$$

## Finding the *p*-value

Just as in the previous examples of *p*-values, there are two easy ways to find a *p*-value for a $\chi^2$ test:

* Use R, or other software packages
* Use a table (back of the book, or internet)

<center>
```{r, out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_4_chisquare.png")
```
</center>

(this is what a $\chi^2$ distribution looks like)

## Finding the *p*-value

**Method 1**: use R

```{r}
pchisq(q = 1.3121, df = 4, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

Since this *p*-value is (very!) not small, we do not have evidence to reject the null hypothesis, so we cannot conclude that goals vary by grade.

## Finding the *p*-value

**Method 2**: use a lookup table
<div style="font-size:20px;">
<center>
```{r, out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_4_chisquare_table.png")
```
</center>

This table is a bit trickier to read: what we do is look at the **row** that corresponds to our *df*, then try to find our test statistic of 1.3121 on the table. Do you see it?
</div>

## Practice

From using the table, what is the correct *p*-value for this hypothesis test?

<div style="float:left; display:inline-block; width:40%;">
1. More than 0.3
2. Between 0.3 and 0.2
3. Between 0.2 and 0.1
4. Between 0.1 and 0.05
5. Less than 0.001
</div>
<div style="display:inline-block; width:60%;">
```{r, out.width = "500px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_4_chisquare_table.png")
```
</div>

## Practice

From using the table, what is the correct *p*-value for this hypothesis test?

<div style="float:left; display:inline-block; width:40%;">
1. <span id="highlight">More than 0.3</span>
2. Between 0.3 and 0.2
3. Between 0.2 and 0.1
4. Between 0.1 and 0.05
5. Less than 0.001
</div>
<div style="display:inline-block; width:60%;">
```{r, out.width = "500px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_4_chisquare_table.png")
```
</div>

## Conclusion

What does the data suggest about goals and grade-level? Remember:

* $H_0$: grade and goals are independent. Goals do not vary by grade.
* $H_A$: grade and goals are dependent. Goals vary by grade.

Since we have *p*>0.3, we do not have a small *p*, and we cannot reject the null. Thus, we fail to reject the null hypothesis: the data do not provide convincing evidence that grade and goals are dependent. It does not appear that goals vary by grade.

## Tests for Two Categorical Variables

There are **two** tests which can be used to determine whether two categorical variables are related. 

Which test you use depends on **how** the data were **collected**. Both methods use two-way tables, and are
conducted in similar ways. 

## Tests for Two Categorical Variables

The two tests are called the **Test of Homogeneity** (Test of Sameness) and the **Test of Independence**.

* The Test for Homogeneity collects two (or more) **independent** samples from multiple populations
    - each object is assigned a categorical value which keeps track  of which group it is from
    - each object is then measured with respect to a different, second, categorical variable
* The Test for Independence collects **one** sample
    - each object in the sample is measured with respect to **two** categorical response variables
    
## Examples

* If we collect a large sample of people, and record their marital status and income ...
* If we collect a random sample of male and female opinions on global warming
* If we conduct a large survey on undergraduate students at Trent ...
* If we conduct a large survey on undergraduate students in Ontario ...
* If we conduct a large survey on undergraduate students in Ontario, by conducting a number of smaller surveys at each university in Ontario ...


## Similarities in the Two Approaches

* In both situations we are interested in knowing whether the two categorical variables are related or unrelated
* Both tests use the same $\chi^2$ test statistic, formula, and $p$-value method
* The **difference** is in the hypotheses and interpretation/conclusion

## Example: GSS

The General Social Survey asked Canadian adults: “There are 
always some people whose ideas are considered bad or 
dangerous by other people. For instance, somebody who is 
against churches and religion. If such a person wanted to make a 
speech in your (city/town/community) against churches and 
religion, should he be allowed to speak, or not?” Respondents 
were also asked about their income, and categorized into four 
income levels (in $thousands). The responses for these two 
questions are summarized in the two‐way table below:

<center>
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_4_gss.png")
```
</center>

## Example: Obesity

A study reported in the medical journal Obesity analyzed data from the 
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Obesity was defined 
as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more. The research subjects 
were followed from adolescence to adulthood, and all the people in the 
sample were categorized in terms of whether they were obese and 
whether they were dating, cohabiting, or married. What frequencies 
should we expect if these variables are not related to each other?

<center>
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_3_4_obesity.png")
```
</center>

## Example: Polling
A polling organization asks a random sample of people for 
their party preference (Liberal, Conservative, NDP, Green, or 
other) and whether they think the minimum wage should be 
raised, and the organization wanted to test whether party 
preference and opinion on minimum wage are related.

## Example: Surgery

A large number of surgery patients get infections after 
surgery, which can sometimes be quite serious. Researchers 
randomly assigned some surgery patients to receive a simple 
antibiotic ointment after surgery, others to receive a 
placebo, and still others to receive just cleansing with soap. 
We want to test the relationship between treatment and 
whether or not patients get an infection after surgery.

## Tests of Homogeneity and Independence (both!)

* **Hypotheses**: 
    - $H_0$: there is no relationship between the two variables
    - $H_A$: there is a relationship between the two variables
* **Requirements**
    - Random samples (independent observations)
    - large samples (expected frequencies $\geq 5$)

If we have this setup, then the $\chi^2$ test statistic follows a $\chi^2$ distribution with $(R-1)\cdot(C-1)$ degrees of freedom.

## Example: GSS (different data) {.smaller}

Is a person’s level of education related to their marital status? From 
the Statistics Canada General Social Survey (GSS) conducted in 2011, 
we took a random sample of 924 adults (aged 18 and older), 
measuring the marital status of each (married, common‐law, divorced, 
widowed, single) and their highest level of completed education (high 
school, college/technical school, university, graduate school). 

               HS   Clg     Uni  Grad
-------     -----  -----  -----  -----
Married       104   156     110    117
Common-Law     23    32      30     19
Divorced       76     0       0      0
Widowed        28    10       3      3
Single        171    29       6      8

## Example: GSS

We can do this analysis in R.

```{r}
Educ <- matrix(data = c(104, 156, 110, 117, 23, 32, 30, 19, 76, 0, 0, 0, 28, 10, 3, 3, 
                        171, 29, 6, 8),
               nrow = 5, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
chisq.test(Educ)
```

This is a single sample with two measurements per object (person), so we are performing a $\chi^2$ Test
of Independence. Our $p$-value is extremely small, so we reject the null.

## Example: GSS 

* The $\chi^2_\text{test} = 349.29$
* The $p$-value is $p < 0.00001$

The conclusion is then that we do have evidence, at a $\alpha = 0.01$ level, to reject the null hypothesis,
and conclude that there is a relationship between marital status and highest educational level completed.

## Drawbacks of the $\chi^2$ Test

The $\chi^2$ test reveals only whether two variables **are** related, but not what that relationship is.

If both categorical variables only have two categories (a $2\times 2$ two-way table), the data can be analyzed
using a two-proportion $z$ test instead, which gives more information (we can setup one-tailed tests specifically).

## Vaccination and Autism

Does the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine  cause ASD (autism spectrum disorder) in children?
The data in the two‐way table are from a study that  investigated when ASD symptoms began in a child, and 
if their onset is related to when the child received the  MMR vaccine. Children in the study had experienced a 
gastrointestinal (GI) event, which is a common side effect of the MMR vaccine.

Timing of Vaccination    Developed ASD    Did Not Develop ASD
---------------------    -------------    -------------------
Received MMR before GI       12                 3
Received MMR after GI        13                10

## Vaccination and Autism (ctd.)

We want to determine if there is a connection (relationship) between receiving the MMR vaccine and the
onset of ASD symptoms.

We can test:

* $H_0$: the onset of ASD symptoms is independent of when the child receives the MMR vaccine
* $H_A$: the onset of ASD symptoms is related to when the child receives the MMR vaccine

## Vaccination and Autism (ctd.)

The results of the test are:

```{r}
mmr <- matrix(data = c(12, 3, 13, 10), nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
chisq.test(mmr)
```

From this, we **fail to reject $H_0$**, so we conclude that the timing of the MMR vaccine and the onset of
ASD symptoms are not related.
